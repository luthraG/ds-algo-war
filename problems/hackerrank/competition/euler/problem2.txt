Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first terms will be:

					1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Input Format

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10**5
10 <= N <= 10**16

Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case.
